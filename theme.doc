theme_and_analysis: The series was noted for its subversions of the heist genre. While heist films are
            usually told with a rational male Anglo-centric focus, the series reframes the heist story by
            giving it a strong Spanish identity and telling it from a female perspective through Tokyo.[63]
            The producers regarded the cultural identity as an important part of the personality of the
            series, as it made the story more relatable for viewers.[18] They also avoided adapting the
            series to international tastes,[18] which helped to set it apart from the usual American TV
            series[64] and raised international awareness of Spanish sensibilities.[18] Emotional dynamics
            like the passion and impulsivity of friendship and love offset the perfect strategic crime for
            increased tension.[49][63] Nearly all main characters, including the relationship-opposing
            Professor, eventually succumb to love,[55] for which the series received comparisons to
            telenovelas.[6][65] Comedic elements, which were compared to Back to the Future[21] and black
            comedy,[52] also offset the heist tension.[66] The heist film formula is subverted by the heist
            starting straight after the opening credits instead of lingering on how the gang is brought
            together.[67]
